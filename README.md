# dialpad-translator
Translates a phone number with a dialpad to a phone number with words embedded

For example, it translates '2010043556' into '20100hello'.

This script only replaces one sequence of digits into a word. I would like to translate multiple sequences in a phone number into multiple words like '4355696754' to 'helloworld'.
